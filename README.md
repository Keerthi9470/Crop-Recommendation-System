# Crop Recommendation System Using Machine Learning

This project predicts the best crop to cultivate based on soil and climate conditions using various machine learning models.

## Features

- Predict the most suitable crop using:
  - Nitrogen (N)
  - Phosphorus (P)
  - Potassium (K)
  - Temperature
  - Humidity
  - pH
  - Rainfall
- Models evaluated: Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost
- Web interface using Flask

## Best Performing Model
**Random Forest** with an accuracy of **99.32%**
